The test set does not contain the target variable. The true values of the target variable will be discussed during the exam.

1. Exploratory data analysis of the train data set
2. Modeling the train data according to three different approaches
   a. logistic regression
   b. random forests
   c. neural networks
3. Compare the results and choose the best model
4. Apply the model to the test data and predict the target values
5. Provide the file of the test data with the predicted values
